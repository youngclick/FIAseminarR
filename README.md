# FIAseminarR
Use FIA full dataset (eastern US forest) 
1. Conduct EDA
2. Calculate species richness (sr) at grid level
3. Calculate average sr aggregated at the latitudinal band
4. Calculate the moving average at 0.5 degree interval
5. Estimate the SR using bootstrapping methods (1000 times simulation) and report mean and std. sr
6. Present your work using ggplot
